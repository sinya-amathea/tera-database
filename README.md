# tera-database
Public repo for the TERA database browser web application: https://tera.horizonofdawn.net/  
The webapp provides data from official TERA version 115 for PC.  
The data provided can differ to currently active private servers.  

The application is still under heavy development and I'm adding features during my free time.  
Some planned features are:
- Skills, categorized by class and 'functionallity'
  - Glyphs linked to those skills
- Abnormatilies
- Predefined item filters (costumes, weapons, classes etc.)

## Reporting an issue
Create a new issue for missing icons, data, functions or application errors.

I'm aware that the app looks ugly on mobile or smaller screen sizes, I *maybe* fix that at some point.  
But I'm not giving that high priority. :D
